# Hello there friends! <img alt="Fire" src='images\blueblob_jump.gif' width="36" height="36">

## My name is Tyrell ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Front-End developer with a focus on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React. I am located in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

## At a core, I am a creative person, and coding fully scratches my creative itch. Having consistent problems to solve that require creative thinking is what keeps me coming back day after day. I get tremendous satisfaction from creating something beautiful and functional out of nothing. My goal is to have a successful career as a developer, and in turn, get to do something that I love every single day.
